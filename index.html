            <h2>BIO</h2>
            <p>Growing up in Zaun, Jinx had trouble fitting in. Jinx had ambition and entrepreneurship, a drive to prove her own worth. 
                Those close to her didnâ€™t understand her clever ideas, and never did they listen to her suggestions. 
                As such, Jinx found meaning to her life elsewhere, climbing her way up the ladder through sheer hard work.
                Having to take care of herself for a big part of her life, Jinx, blossomed into the bombastic wonder she is today, 
                spreading explosive positivity to those fortunate to cross her path.
